    """relationship with item model (see the other class). lazy defines when SQLAlchemy will load the data from the 
    database: 
    * 'select': (default: true) means that SQLAlchemy will load the data as necessary in one go using a 
    standard select statement. 
    * 'joined': tells SQLAlchemy to load the relationship in the same query as the parent 
    using a JOIN statement. 
    * 'subquery': works like 'joined' but instead SQLAlchemy will use a subquery. 
    * 'dynamic': is special and can be useful if you have many items and always want to apply additional SQL filters to 
    them. Instead of loading the items SQLAlchemy will return another query object which you can further refine before 
    loading the items. Note that this cannot be turned into a different loading strategy when querying so itâ€™s often 
    a good idea to avoid using this in favor of lazy=True. A query object equivalent to a dynamic user.addresses 
    relationship can be created using Address.query.with_parent(user) while still being able to use lazy or eager 
    loading on the relationship itself as necessary. 
    
    It is also possible to add a back ref on the child object, in this case ItemModel, to see the store object
    associated with the child using:
    items = db.relationship('ItemModel', lazy='dynamic', backref=db.backref('store', lazy='joined'))
    at this point in the ItemModel is possible to reference the self.store property (without ever having created it)
